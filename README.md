# Othello
## Description
This is the game of Othello created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and these technologies were used for a class project. Some of the challenges that were faced when creating this project was implementing the correct logic for the game to understand legal moves, as well as to correctly flip pieces according to these rules. Another challenge faced when creating this project was incorporating an automated opponent turn that would place pieces accordingly in the same fashion. Some features that I would like to include at a later date would be a difficutly setting, as well as the option to choose which color to play as, and include a rules page so that anyone new to the game can read it and play.

## How to Play
The app was made using HTML, so in order to play, one can navigate to my github pages: https://sapphire-coder.github.io/Sapphire-Coder.github.io-Othello/ to play the game. After navigating to the site, it defaults to your turn and you may place a piece. After that, you will have to wait for the computer to place their piece if possible, and continue with your next turn afterwards.

## Personal Thoughts
The reason I created Othello was because I enjoy the game and wanted to test if I could implement the correct logic to recreate it. I learned that even though it is simple to explain the game when speaking to another person, it is difficult to have the programming language understand and implement the rules accordingly.
